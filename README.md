# LCS-Predictions
Power rankings of 2021 LCS Spring Split before playoffs. The code displays a table containing a colum that shows the rankings of LCS teams.

This is the link to download the 2021 data set: https://oracleselixir.com/tools/downloads. 
Click on the link, then download the 2021 data set. 
That is the file that I titled "lol_data.csv" I can't upload the original data set I used since it is too big of a file size. 
It seems that it has updated since the last time I used it, so it may have changed. If the updates makes the result different, you can look
at my video to see the actual results of my code or you can message me on discord @Saytoe#7910.
